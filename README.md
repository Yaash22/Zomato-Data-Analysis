# Zomato-Data-Analysis

This project delves into food order data to answer key questions such as:

Which cuisines are most popular in different cities?
How do ratings correlate with other factors like cost and location?
What are the top-rated restaurants in specific localities?
Can we identify potential areas for new restaurant openings based on data-driven insights?
Through data visualization and statistical analysis, this project aims to provide actionable insights for both consumers and businesses in the food industry. By applying machine learning models, we seek to develop predictive systems that forecast order volumes and estimate delivery times.
